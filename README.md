# Auto Hot Key Scripts

## Surface Pen

Makes use of the fact that the surface pen's top button sends F18, F19, and F20 keystrokes as long press, double click, and single click respectively.

### Single Click
* Launch Onenote if not running
* Bring Onenote to foreground if running but not the active window
* Open Quicklaunch Item 5 if Onenote is running and is the active window
    * in my case this is the pen choice panel

### Double Click
* If Onenote is not the active program then clip to onenote
* If onenote is the active tab then run Quicklaunch Item 4 and press x
    * In my case the initiates Ink to Test

### Long Press
* toggle tablet mode in windows 10
    * this is a bit of a hack that opens settings, switches to tablet mode, then closes settings
